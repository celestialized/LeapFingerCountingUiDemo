# LeapFingerCountingUiDemo
My submission for the Ultraleap Beyond Touchscreens competition

## Requirements ##

To build LeapFingerCountingUiDemo you will need to do the following:

+  Download the [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) library.
+  Link the project to the JUCE library code - the easiest way to do this is to build the [Projucer](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/tree/master/extras/Projucer) application, open the [LeapFingerCountingUiDemo.jucer](https://github.com/liamlacey/LeapFingerCountingUiDemo/blob/master/LeapFingerCountingUiDemo.jucer) file, and point the project to the location of the JUCE library.
